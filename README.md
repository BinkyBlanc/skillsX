# SkillsX
SkillsX is an app prototype that combines networking, knowledge-sharing, and personal growth into one seamless experience. 

**How it Works:**

**1. Create a Profile:** Start by creating a personal profile that outlines your skills, interests, and background. The more detailed and up-to-date your profile is, the better youâ€™ll connect with others who share similar or complementary expertise.

**2. Search and Connect:** Use the search function to find individuals who match your interests, skills, or career goals. You can easily send a message or start a conversation to explore potential collaboration opportunities or gain advice.

**3. Interact and Rate:** After engaging in a conversation or collaboration, rate the interaction using the star system. Your feedback helps others gauge the quality of connections, while also helping to build your own reputation in the community.

**4. Grow Your Network:** As you engage with others, skillsX recommends more potential connections based on the data from your interactions. This continuous cycle of connection and feedback ensures a rich, engaged community where people share and learn from each other.

**5. Update Your Profile:** Keep your profile up-to-date with your latest achievements, skills, or interests. This allows other users to see your growth and stay current on your expertise.
